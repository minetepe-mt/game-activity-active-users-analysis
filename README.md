# Game Activity & Active Users Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing game activity and active user behavior using Google Sheets.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to understand how users interact with different games over time by analyzing activity data and active user metrics.  
The project explores user engagement patterns and provides insights into which games generate higher activity and consistency.

## 🔍 Key Questions
- How many active users are there over time?
- Which games show higher engagement levels?
- How does user activity change across different dates?
- Are there noticeable trends or patterns in user behavior?

## 📈 Metrics Analyzed
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Game-level activity counts
- User participation across dates
- Activity distribution by game

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Google Sheets
- Excel-style formulas (ARRAYFORMULA, COUNTIFS, COUNTUNIQUEIFS)
- Date-based analysis
- Basic data cleaning and transformation

## 📄 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- User IDs
- Game names
- Activity timestamps
- Game activity logs

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Practiced active user calculations using spreadsheet formulas
- Gained hands-on experience with time-based user activity analysis
- Improved ability to translate raw activity data into meaningful insights

## 🔗 Project Files
- Google Sheets file containing raw data and analysis
- Exported Excel version for version control
